abstract = {Aim of the present chapter is to provide an in-depth survey of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods, including both conceptual aspects of the mixed kinematical description and numerical implementation details. Applications are discussed in °uid dynamics, nonlinear solid mechanics and coupled problems describing °uid-structure interaction. The need for an adequate mesh update strategy is underlined and various automatic mesh displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh adaptation techniques aiming at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible °ow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems. This includes the treatment of convective terms in the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy, as well as a discussion of stress update procedures for materials with history-dependent constitutive behaviour.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments with a side-by-side arrangement of two vertical, high aspect ratio (length over diameter) and low mass ratio (mass over mass of displaced fluid) cylinders, pin-jointed at the ends and vibrating at low mode number, were carried out in a free-surface water channel. The dynamic response of the models under two different wake interference situations is presented here. Initially, one of the cylinders was fixed and the other was completely free to move. In a second battery of experiments both cylinders were free to vibrate. A very large parameter space was covered by varying the free-stream flow speeds, the natural frequencies of the system and the separation between the models, allowing the identification of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and wake-coupled VIV (WCVIV). Amplitudes, frequencies and phase synchronisation between the models are presented. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Potential flow and 2-D Navier-Stokes calculations are used to investigate the role of vortex shedding in the non-resonant flow-induced vibration of periodic tube arrays. This dual approach untangles the effects of potential and vortical flow. The negative damping theory is shown to be inconsistent with the Navier-Stokes simulations, and allowing only a single degree of freedom in tube motion significantly overestimates the critical velocity. In contrast, Navier-Stokes simulations which allow all tubes to move in both the transverse and streamwise directions give results in good agreement with experiment. Somewhat surprisingly, potential flow calculations including an artificial phase lag between fluid force and tube motion give reasonably accurate results for a wide range of phase lags. This may be due to the fact that the most unstable mode at onset appears to be streamwise anti-phase (not whirling), as observed in the potential flow case. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents results of a numerical study of vortex-induced vibrations of two side-by-side circular cylinders of different diameters in steady incompressible flow. The two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a SST k ?? turbulence model are solved using the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method and the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme. The diameter ratio of the two cylinders is fixed at 0.1 and the mass ratio of both cylinders is 5.0. Both cylinders are constrained to oscillate in the transverse direction only. The Reynolds number based on the large cylinder diameter and free stream velocity is fixed at 5000. The effects of the reduced velocities of the cylinders on the vibration amplitude and vortex shedding regimes are investigated. It is found that for the range of parameters considered, collision between the two cylinders is dependent on the difference of the reduced velocities of the cylinders. Presence of the small cylinder in the proximity of the large one appears to have significant effects on the vortex shedding regime and vibration amplitude of the large cylinder. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A cell boundary element method is used to solve the two-dimensional incompressible NavierStokes equation for vortex-shedding flows around arrays of cylinders. The method is a hybrid scheme using a boundary element method in each fluid cell discretization with a finite element procedure to solve for the global fluid problem. Computations are presented of two-dimensional flow characteristics and interactive forces associated with flows around four equispaced cylinders of equal diameter, and two cylinders, one with circular cross-section and the other elliptical. It was found that behaviour such as in-phase vortex-shedding, anti-phase vortex shedding and synchronized vortex shedding, which are well-known characteristics for flows past arrangements of two circular cylinders, were also present in these more complicated flows. The application of the cell boundary element method to these flow problems, using an unstructured fluid domain mesh idealization, proved straightforward and required no modification for variation of the number of bodies or their shape.},

abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

We bring together new concepts and phenomena generic to vortex-induced vibration (VIV) systems, and pay special attention to the vortex dynamics and energy transfer that give rise to modes of vibration, the importance of mass and damping, the concept of a critical mass, the relationship between force and vorticity, and the concept of “effective elasticity”, among other points. We present new vortex wake modes, generally in the framework of a map of vortex modes compiled from forced vibration studies, some of which cause free vibration. Some discussion focuses on topics of current debate, such as the decomposition of force, the relevance of the paradigm flow of an elastically mounted cylinder to more complex systems, and the relationship between forced or free vibration.},

abstract = {Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of two elastically coupled circular cylinders in side-by-side arrangement is investigated numerically. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the finite element method for simulating the flow and the equation of motion is solved for calculating the vibration. The mass ratio (the ratio of the mass of the cylinder to the displaced fluid mass) is 2 and the Reynolds number is 5000 in the simulations. Simulations are carried out for one symmetric configuration (referred to be Case A) and one asymmetric configuration (referred to be Case B). In both Case A and Case B, the primary response frequencies of the two cylinders are found to be the same both inside and outside the lock-in regimes. Five response regimes are found in both cases and they are the first-mode lock-in regime, the second-mode lock-in regime, the sum-frequency lock-in regime and two transition regimes. When the vibration is transiting from the first- to the second-mode lock-in regimes, the vibration of each cylinder contains both first- and the second-mode natural frequencies, and the vibrations are usually irregular. In the transition regime between the second-mode lock-in and the sum-frequency lock-in regimes, the response frequencies of both cylinders increases with an increase in the reduced velocity until they are close to the sum of the two natural frequencies. In both cases, the lower boundary reduced velocity of the total lock-in regime (the sum of the five lock-in regimes) is about 3 and the upper boundary reduced velocity is about 11 times the first-to-second-mode natural frequency ratio. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, flow past around four cylinders which are arranged as a square shape at a Reynolds number of 200 is numerically investigated with a spectral element method. To validate the numerical method for incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, benchmark problems of flow past a single and two tandem cylinders are employed, with the numerical results in a good agreement with the available literatures. Then the study concentrates on the flow characteristics of two groups of cases, respectively, with incidence angle $\alpha$=0° and $\alpha$=45°. By changing the spacing ratios L/D from 1.5 to 4.0 (L is the center-to-center distance and D the cylinder diameter), the flow characteristics, including the flow patterns, statistical force parameters such as the drag and lift coefficients as well as wake oscillation frequencies (Strouhal numbers) are investigated. Numerical results show that in each case there are around three wake flow patterns which are more related with the spacing ratio. In addition, the force parameters are highly affected by the flow patterns.},

abstract = {Two-degree-of-freedom Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of two rigidly coupled circular cylinders of different diameters at a low Reynolds number of 250 is investigated numerically. While the diameter ratio and the mass ratio are kept constant, the study is focused on the effect of the position angle of the small cylinder on the lock-in regime of the VIV. Simulations are carried out for position angles $\alpha$ of the small cylinder ranging from 0° to 180° with an interval of 22.5° and the reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 with an increment of 1. In order to find the effect of the gap between the two cylinders on the vibration, two gap-to-diameter ratios (0 and 0.2) are considered. It is found that compared with a single cylinder case, the lock-in regime of the reduced velocity is widened significantly when the position angle of the small cylinder is $\alpha$ = 0°, 22.5°, 90°, or 112.5°. Pulsed beating phenomenon characterized by regular vibration with occasional high-amplitude disturbances at regular or irregular intervals is observed at G = 0 and $\alpha$ = 90°. At $\alpha$ = 135°, more than one lock-in regimes are observed in the computed range of reduced velocity for both gaps (G = 0 and 0.2). Setting a small gap (gap-to-diameter ratio of 0.2) between the two cylinders mitigates the vibration by narrowing the lock-in regime and reducing the vibration amplitude.},

The NavierStokes equations for incompressible fluid flow are solved for a two-dimensional case along with the equations of motion of the cylinder that is mounted on lightly damped spring supports. The cylinder is allowed to vibrate, both in the in-line and in the cross-flow directions. Results of the computations are presented for various values of the structural frequency of the oscillator, including those that are sub and superharmonics of the vortex-shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder. In most of the cases, the trajectory of the cylinder corresponds to a Lissajou figure of 8. Lock-in is observed for a range of values of the structural frequency. Over a certain range of structural frequency (Fs oscillating cylinder does not match Fs the vortex-shedding frequency of the exactly; there is a slight detuning. This phenomenon is referred to as soft-lock-in. Computations show that this detuning disappears when the mass of the cylinder is significantly larger than the mass of the surrounding fluid it displaces. A self-limiting nature of the oscillator with respect to cross-flow vibration amplitude is observed. It is believed that the detuning of the vortex-shedding frequency from the structural frequency is a mechanism of the oscillator to self-limit its vibration amplitude. The dependence of the unsteady solution on the spatial resolution of the finite element mesh is also investigated.},

abstract = {The interaction between two adjacent cylinders immersed in fluid is studied numerically by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a finite element method (FEM). The two rigid cylinders are immersed in otherwise stationary fluid. One cylinder (C1) undergoes forced vibration that disturbs the fluid, whereas another cylinder (C2), which has one-degree-of-freedom (1DOF), vibrates correspondingly under the action of the imbalanced hydrodynamic force. All the simulations carried out in this study have a constant Reynolds number of 100 and a constant mass ratio of 2.5. Simulations are conducted with 9 initial gap ratios, G, ranging from 0.05 to 3 times of the cylinder diameter, with various forced vibration amplitude A1 and frequency f1 of C1. We find that C2's amplitude (A2) reaches maximum when C1's vibration frequency (f1) is approximately 80% of C2's structural natural frequency (fn). The increase of C1's amplitude (A1) leads to the rise of C2's amplitude (A2) but the decrease of its relative amplitude (A2/A1). The increase in A1 also slightly reduces the value of f1 at the maximum A2. In addition, the vibration centre of C1 is observed to shift away from original location in cases with the large gap ratio. The shift becomes increasingly obvious with an increase of A1 and f1. Finally, C2 is found to respond to the vibration of C1 with bigger amplitude in some situations with small gap ratios, which can be interpreted as the occurrence of resonance.},

As for the cylinder motions, a two-degree-of-freedom structural dynamics model is invoked. Fluid-structure interactions are resolved through iteration at the same time step. The calculated results for the case of rigid cylinder indicated that the non-dimensional vortex shedding frequency (or the Strouhal frequency) of a square cylinder at rest is 0.13, which is in good agreement with the published results. For the elastic case, with the change of the cylinder's natural frequency, "lock-in" and "beat" phenomena were successfully captured. The phenomena of resonance and galloping can also be indicated.},

The experiments are carried out at Reynolds numbers, Re, of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 and nondimensional rotation rates, $\alpha$ , varying from 0 to 5. The spacing ratios, T / D , are 1.8, 2.5, 4.0, and 7.5. Two possibilities of rotations are considered with the cylinder surfaces in between the two cylinders moving upstream in one case (inward rotation case) and downstream in the other (outward rotation case). The diagnostics is done by flow visualization using hydrogen bubble technique and quantitative measurements using particle imagevelocimetry(PIV). We present, using extensive flow visualization, the global view of the wake structure at Re of 200 for various rotation rates, and two senses. Vortex shedding suppression is studied through flow visualization and/or PIV at various Re's, T / D 's, and two senses. Vortex shedding is found to be suppressed in the inward rotation cases at all Re and T / D 's. The value of $\alpha$ corresponding to vortex shedding suppression, $\alpha$ s , in the inward rotation case is ∼ 2.0 for Re of 200–500 at all T / D 's. The value of $\alpha$ s for Re of 100 in the case of inward rotation shows an increasing trend with T / D from T / D = 1.8 to 4.0 with $\alpha$ s changing from 1.2 to 1.7; further increase of T / D does not change $\alpha$ s . For outward rotation cases, vortex shedding suppression is clearly observed for Re of 100 and for all values of T / D ; however, for higher Re, vortex shedding suppression is observed for T / D of 4.0 and 7.5 only. The measurements of $\alpha$ s in this case showed a decreasing trend with increasing T / D . Symmetry breaking is reported for inward rotation case near $\alpha$ = 1.35 for T / D = 2.5 at Re of 200 where the wake pattern changes from in-phase to antiphase mode.},

abstract = {Oscillatory flow past two circular cylinders in side-by-side and tandem arrangements at low Reynolds numbers is simulated numerically by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a finite-element method (FEM). The aim of this study is to identify the flow regimes of the two-cylinder system at different gap arrangements and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers (KC). Simulations are conducted at seven gap ratios G (G = L/D where L is the cylinder-to-cylinder gap and D the diameter of a cylinder) of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and KC ranging from 1 to 12 with an interval of 0.25. The flow regimes that have been identified for oscillatory flow around a single cylinder are also observed in the two-cylinder system but with different flow patterns due to the interactions between the two cylinders. In the side-by-side arrangement, the vortex shedding from the gap between the two cylinders dominates when the gap ratio is small, resulting in the gap vortex shedding (GVS) regime, which is different from any of the flow regimes identified for a single cylinder. For intermediate gap ratios of 1.5 and 2 in the side-by-side arrangement, the vortex shedding mode from one side of each cylinder is not necessarily the same as that from the other side, forming a so-called combined flow regime. When the gap ratio between the two cylinders is sufficiently large, the vortex shedding from each cylinder is similar to that of a single cylinder. In the tandem arrangement, when the gap between the two cylinders is very small, the flow regimes are similar to that of a single cylinder. For large gap ratios in the tandem arrangement, the vortex shedding flows from the gap side of the two cylinders interact and those from the outer sides of the cylinders are less affected by the existence of the other cylinder and similar to that of a single cylinder. Strong interaction between the vortex shedding flows from the two cylinders makes the flow very irregular at large KC values for both side-by-side and tandem arrangements.},

abstract = {Free vibrations of a square cylinder at zero incidence are studied. A stabilized space-time finite-element method has been used to discretize the equations of fluid flow in two-dimensions. The cylinder mounted on elastic supports, with low mass ratio (m*=10), is allowed to undergo in-line as well as transverse vibrations. The coefficient of structural damping is assigned a zero value. The Reynolds number, Re, is based on the edge length of the cylinder and free-stream speed. The reduced natural frequency is defined as FN=14.39/Re. For a blockage of 0.05, results are presented for 60???Re???250. As the Reynolds number is progressively increased, the regimes of flow observed are 'primary' lock-in, desynchronization and 'secondary' lock-in. It is found that the width of the 'primary' lock-in zone for a square cylinder with sharp corners is very narrow. The variation of transverse response with Re is associated with the initial, lower and 'secondary' lower branches. Transition between the initial and lower branches is hysteretic. Hysteresis in the cylinder response as well as aerodynamic coefficients is observed close to the lower-Re extremity of the 'primary' lock-in zone. A hysteretic jump at Re=87 marks the onset of lock-in regime. The 2S mode of vortex shedding is observed along the initial branch. Along the lower branch, the modes of vortex shedding are 2S and C(2S). Vortex shedding along the 'secondary' lower branch is via the 2S and 2P modes. The free vibration characteristics of a square differ, in several fundamental aspects, from those of a circular cylinder reported by Prasanth and Mittal (2008a,b). Compared to the circle, a much narrower lock-in zone along with smaller (about 50%) transverse amplitude is observed for the square for Re???150. The lock-in extremities of a circular cylinder for Re???150 and B=0.05 are associated with two hysteresis loops as opposed to one for a square cylinder. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although there are a great many papers dedicated to the problem of a cylinder vibrating transverse to a fluid flow ($Y$-motion), there are almost no papers on the more practical case of vortex-induced vibration in two degrees of freedom ($X,Y$ motion) where the mass and natural frequencies are precisely the same in both $X$- and $Y$-directions. We have designed the present pendulum apparatus to achieve both of these criteria. Even down to the low mass ratios, where $m^*\,{=}\,6$, it is remarkable that the freedom to oscillate in-line with the flow affects the transverse vibration surprisingly little. The same response branches, peak amplitudes, and vortex wake modes are found for both $Y$-only and $X,Y$ motion. There is, however, a dramatic change in the fluid–structure interactions when mass ratios are reduced below $m^*\,{=}\,6$. A new amplitude response branch with significant streamwise motion appears, in what we call the ‘super-upper' branch, yielding massive amplitudes of 3 diameters peak-to-peak ($A^*_Y \,{\sim}\, 1.5$). We discover a corresponding periodic vortex wake mode, comprising a triplet of vortices being formed in each half-cycle, in what we define as a ‘2T' mode. We qualitatively interpret the principal vortex dynamics and vortex forces which yield a positive rate of energy transfer ($\dot{e}_V$) causing the body vibration, using the following simple equation: \[\dot{e}_V = 2 {\Gamma}^* U^*_V \skew3\dot{Y}\] where $\Gamma^*$ is vortex strength, $U^*_V$ is the speed downstream of the dominant near-wake vorticity, and $\skew3\dot{Y}$ is the transverse velocity of the body. This simple approach suggests that the massive amplitude of vibration for the 2T mode is principally attributed to the energy transfer from the ‘third' vortex of each triplet, which is not present in the lower-amplitude 2P mode. We also find two low-speed streamwise vibration modes, which is not unexpected, since they correspond to the first and second excitation modes of vibration for flexible cantilevers. By considering equations of motion for the two degrees of freedom, we find a critical mass, $m^*_{\hbox{\scriptsize\it crit}} \,{=}\, 0.52$, similar to recent $Y$-only studies, below which the large-amplitude vibrations persist to infinite flow velocity. We show that the critical mass $m^*_{\hbox{\scriptsize\it crit}}$ is the same for the $X$- and $Y$-directions, which ensures that the shapes of $X, Y$ trajectories can retain their form as the velocity becomes large. The extensive studies of vortex-induced vibration for $Y$-only body motions, built up over the last 35 years, remain of strong relevance to the case of two degrees of freedom, for $m^* \,{>}\, 6$. It is only for ‘small' mass ratios, $m^* \,{<}\, 6$, that one observes a rather dramatic departure from previous results, which would suggest a possible modification to offshore design codes.},

It is now feasible to simulate complex engineering flows using LES. However, apart from the computing power, significant challenges still remain for LES to reach a level of maturity that brings this approach to the mainstream of engineering and industrial computations. This paper will describe briefly LES formalism first, present a quick glance at its history, review its current state focusing mainly on its applications in transitional flows and gas turbine combustor flows, discuss some major modelling and numerical challenges/issues that we are facing now and in the near future, and finish with the concluding remarks.},

Several distinct flow patterns were observed. Dependent on $\alpha$, the flow was classified into three basic flow regimes. Each regime has its own dominant flow pattern and could lead to different problems. Two distinct flow patterns, which could lead to strong flow-induced vibration, were observed in this experiment. One is the impingement of oncoming vortices on the cylinders directly. The other is the formation of a jet flow between the near wake (or alternatively known as stagnation wake) of the upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder and such a jet flow is most prominent at $\alpha$ = 15°. These experimental results can be used to validate numerical simulation methods developed to investigate flows around cylinder arrays. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a rotating circular cylinder at a low Reynolds number of 150 and a low mass ratio of 2 is studied numerically. Simulations are conducted at three rotation rates of $\alpha$ = 0, 0.5, and 1 and reduced velocities in the range of 1–13 with an interval of 0.2. The numerical results show that the rotation of the cylinder increases the response amplitude and widens the lock-in regime for the one-degree-of-freedom (1-dof) VIV in the cross-flow direction. The two-degree-of-freedom (2-dof) responses of the cylinder at $\alpha$ = 0.5 and 1 are significantly different from that at $\alpha$ = 0. For the 2-dof VIV, the response amplitude in the inline direction, which is much smaller than that in the cross-flow direction at $\alpha$ = 0, is increased significantly at $\alpha$ = 0.5 and 1. One initial branch is found at $\alpha$ = 0.5 and two initial branches are found at $\alpha$ = 1. In the initial branches, the response frequency locks onto a frequency that is smaller than the natural frequency of the cylinder and the response amplitude increases with the reduced velocity. The vortex shedding is found to be in the P+S mode for reduced velocities near the higher boundary of the initial branches and 2S mode in all other reduced velocity ranges for the 2-dof VIV. Simulations are conducted under both the increasing and decreasing reduced velocity conditions. A hysteresis region is found near the higher boundary of the lower branch for $\alpha$ = 0, 0.5, and 1 in the 1-dof of VIV and for $\alpha$ = 0 in the 2-dof VIV. The hysteresis region occurs near the higher boundary of the initial branches for $\alpha$ = 0.5 and 1 in the 2-dof VIV. By analysing the component of the force coefficient that is in phase with the velocity of the cylinder, it is found that pressure force excites the vibration and the viscous force damps the vibration in both the inline and the cross-flow directions in the 2-dof VIV. The magnitude of the time averaged pressure and viscous force coefficients that are in phase with the velocities of the cylinder in the lock-in regime are found to be much greater than their counterparts outside the lock-in regime.},

It is verified that the present model can predict well the average velocity and turbulence structure. The drag force and drag coefficient are then calculated using the present model for a number of cases with different solid volume fractions, cylinder Reynolds numbers and patch diameters. It is shown that the drag coefficient increases with increasing solid volume fraction, but decreases with increa- sing Reynolds number. However, the drag coefficient is independent of the diameter of circular batch when the solid volume fraction and Reynolds number are kept constant.},

abstract = {Vortex shedding from an oscillating circular cylinder is studied by numerical solutions of the two-dimensional unsteady Navier–Stokes equations. A physically consistent method is used for the reconstruction of velocity fluxes which arise from discrete equations for the mass and momentum balances. This method ensures a second-order accuracy. Two phenomena are investigated and, in both cases, the cylinder oscillation is forced. The first is the flow induced by the harmonic in-line oscillation of cylinder in water at rest. The Reynolds number is equal to 100 and the Keulegan–Carpenter number is equal to 5. A comparison of phase-averaged velocity vectors between measurements and predictions is presented. Applying the widely used model of Morison to the computed in-line force history, the drag and the inertia coefficients are calculated and compared for different grid levels. Using these to reproduce the force functions, deviations from those originally computed are revealed. The second problem is an investigation of a transversely oscillating cylinder in a uniform flow at fixed Reynolds number equal to 185. The cylinder oscillation frequency ranges between 0{\textperiodcentered}80 and 1{\textperiodcentered}20 of the natural vortex-shedding frequency, and the oscillation amplitude is 20% of the cylinder diameter. As the frequency of excitation of the cylinder increases relative to the inherent vortex formation frequency, the initially formed concentration of vorticity moves closer to the cylinder until a limiting position is reached. At this point, the vorticity concentration abruptly switches to the opposite side of the cylinder. This process induces distinct changes of the topology of the corresponding streamline patterns.},

The equation of motion of the square cylinder is solved to simulate the vibration and the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian scheme is employed to model the interaction between the vibrating cylinder and the fluid flow. The numerical model is validated against the published results of flow past a stationary square cylinder and the results of VIV of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds numbers. The effect of flow approaching angle ($\alpha$) on the response of the square cylinder is investigated. It is found that $\alpha$ affects not only the vibration amplitude but also the lock-in regime. Among the three values of $\alpha$ ($\alpha$ = 0°, 45°, and 22.5°) that are studied, the smallest vibration amplitude and the narrowest lock-in regime occur at $\alpha$ = 0°. It is discovered that the vibration locks in with the natural frequency in two regimes of reduced velocity for $\alpha$ = 22.5°. Single loop vibration trajectories are observed in the lock-in regime at $\alpha$ = 22.5° and 45°, which is distinctively different from VIV of a circular cylinder. As a result, the vibration frequency in the in-line direction is the same as that in the cross-flow direction.},

The model efficiency is validated by comparing its predictions to those of unsteady simulations of fluid-structure interaction of a spring mounted square constrained to move in the direction transverse to the flow. Results show that the model yields good predictions of both the onset of galloping and its amplitude as a function of the Reynolds number at high values of the mass ratio.

abstract = {A new twist on an old model for predicting the vortex-excited vibrations of flexible cylindrical structures is developed. A van der Pol equation, driven by the local transverse motion of the cylinder, is taken as the governing equation for one component of the fluctuating lift force on the cylinder. The second component of the lift force is represented by a stall term which is linearly proportional to the local transverse velocity of the cylinder. In previous models, the van der Pol equation has been employed as the governing equation for the entire fluctuating lift force on the cylinder. The new model preserves the modal scaling principle for the structural response, as initially predicted by the previous models and since verified experimentally. The empirical parameters in the model are related to the physical mass and damping parameters that define the structural properties so that the maximum structural response and the reduced velocity at which it occurs agree with experimental observations. Because of the stall term, the new model provides for an asymptotic, self-limiting structural response at zero structural damping. This asymptotic, self-limiting behavior was not captured by the previous models. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

The experiments are carried out at Reynolds numbers, Re, of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 and nondimensional rotation rates, $\alpha$ , varying from 0 to 5. The spacing ratios, T / D , are 1.8, 2.5, 4.0, and 7.5. Two possibilities of rotations are considered with the cylinder surfaces in between the two cylinders moving upstream in one case (inward rotation case) and downstream in the other (outward rotation case). The diagnostics is done by flow visualization using hydrogen bubble technique and quantitative measurements using particle imagevelocimetry(PIV). We present, using extensive flow visualization, the global view of the wake structure at Re of 200 for various rotation rates, and two senses. Vortex shedding suppression is studied through flow visualization and/or PIV at various Re's, T / D 's, and two senses. Vortex shedding is found to be suppressed in the inward rotation cases at all Re and T / D 's. The value of $\alpha$ corresponding to vortex shedding suppression, $\alpha$ s , in the inward rotation case is ∼ 2.0 for Re of 200–500 at all T / D 's. The value of $\alpha$ s for Re of 100 in the case of inward rotation shows an increasing trend with T / D from T / D = 1.8 to 4.0 with $\alpha$ s changing from 1.2 to 1.7; further increase of T / D does not change $\alpha$ s . For outward rotation cases, vortex shedding suppression is clearly observed for Re of 100 and for all values of T / D ; however, for higher Re, vortex shedding suppression is observed for T / D of 4.0 and 7.5 only. The measurements of $\alpha$ s in this case showed a decreasing trend with increasing T / D . Symmetry breaking is reported for inward rotation case near $\alpha$ = 1.35 for T / D = 2.5 at Re of 200 where the wake pattern changes from in-phase to antiphase mode.},

abstract = {We study the generation of three-dimensional vorticity in tightly packed tube bundles. In particular, our goal is to investigate which conditions (if any) enable the flow to remain two-dimensional for Re>180. We calculated two- and three-dimensional flow through periodic rotated square tube bundles with tight packing, P/D=1.5, using a high resolution pseudo-spectral code with penalization. The tubes are cylinders whose response is modelled as a rigid harmonic oscillator forced by the flow-induced lift. We find that at Re=200 tube motion completely suppresses the three-dimensional instability. At Re=1000 tube motion does not suppress the three-dimensional instability, although the flow does have increased spanwise correlation and the Strouhal number for the two- and three-dimensional flows is approximately the same. The tight packing alone does not suppress the three-dimensional instability. Three-dimensional vorticity drastically reduces fluid forces acting on the tube compared with an equivalent two-dimensional flow.},

abstract = {Time-averaged LDA measurements and time-resolved numerical flow predictions were performed to investigate the laminar flow induced by the harmonic in-line oscillation of a circular cylinder in water at rest. The key parameters, Reynolds number Re and Keulegan-Carpenter number KC, were varied to study three parameter combinations in detail. Good agreement was observed for Re = 100 and KC = 5 between measurements and predictions comparing phase-averaged velocity vectors. For Re = 200 and KC = 10 weakly stable and non-periodic flow patterns occurred, which made repeatable time-averaged measurements impossible. Nevertheless, the experimentally visualized vortex dynamics was reproduced by the two-dimensional computations. For the third combination, Re = 210 and KC = 6, which refers to a totally different flow regime, the computations again resulted in the correct fluid behaviour. Applying the widely used model of Morison et al. to the computed in-line force history, the drag and the added-mass coefficients were calculated and compared for different grid levels and time steps. Using these to reproduce the force functions revealed deviations from those originally computed as already noted in previous studies},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In an experimental study of the vortex-induced oscillations of a long flexible circular cylinder, the observed stationary amplitudes describe an hysteresis loop partially different from earlier studies. Each branch of the loop is associated with a vortex shedding mode and, as a jump from one branch to the other occurs, the phase difference between the cylinder displacement and the vortex shedding undergoes an abrupt change. The critical flow velocities at which the jump occurs concur with the flow visualization observations of Williamson & Roshko (1988) on the vortex shedding modes near the fundamental synchronization region. Impulsive regimes, obtained at a given flow velocity with the cylinder initially at rest or pre-excited, and progressive regimes resulting from a variation of the flow velocity, are examined. The occurrence of bifurcations is detected for a flow velocity range in the case of the impulsive regimes. The coordinates of the bifurcations define a boundary between two vortex shedding modes, a boundary that verifies the critical curve obtained by Williamson & Roshko (1988). The experimental set-up of this study simulates half the wavelength of a vibrating cable, eliminates the end effects present in oscillating rigid cylinder set-up and has one of the lowest damping ratios reported for the study of this phenomenon.},

abstract = {This paper presents the measurements of force coefficients and Strouhal numbers (St) on four cylinders in a square configuration at subcritical Reynolds numbers (Re) using a piezo-electric load cell in a wind tunnel. Six spacing ratios (L/D) varying from 1.69 to 3.83 and 13 angles of incidence $\alpha$ ranging from 0° to 180° at a 15° interval covering all orientations were investigated. With the help of a laser-induced fluorescence visualization technique, it is found that the variation of forces and Strouhal numbers with L/D are governed by three distinct flow patterns. They are: (a) free oscillations of shear layers and vortex formation at large L/D; (b) reattachment of shear layer or shielding flow for intermediate L/D and (c) narrow gap flows for small L/D. Two major causes for large fluctuating forces are discussed in this paper and the force results are compared with other measurements. It is concluded that the flow patterns, i.e., the development and the interferences of the free shear layers and the distribution of the wake vortices of the cylinders play a key role in the variation of the forces and shedding frequencies. Consequently, the downstream cylinders are usually subjected to more serious fluctuating forces under the influence of unsteady wake vortices. Also, the upstream cylinders normally experience larger mean drags than the downstream ones.},

abstract = {Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a square cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100 and a low mass ratio of 3 are studied numerically by solving the Navier-Stokes equations using the finite element method. The equation of motion of the square cylinder is solved to simulate the vibration and the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian scheme is employed to model the interaction between the vibrating cylinder and the fluid flow. The numerical model is validated against the published results of flow past a stationary square cylinder and the results of VIV of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds numbers. The effect of flow approaching angle ($\alpha$) on the response of the square cylinder is investigated. It is found that $\alpha$ affects not only the vibration amplitude but also the lock-in regime. Among the three values of $\alpha$ ($\alpha$ = 0°, 45°, and 22.5°) that are studied, the smallest vibration amplitude and the narrowest lock-in regime occur at $\alpha$ = 0°. It is discovered that the vibration locks in with the natural frequency in two regimes of reduced velocity for $\alpha$ = 22.5°. Single loop vibration trajectories are observed in the lock-in regime at $\alpha$ = 22.5° and 45°, which is distinctively different from VIV of a circular cylinder. As a result, the vibration frequency in the in-line direction is the same as that in the cross-flow direction.},

abstract = {A series of experiments on steady current induced vibration of piggyback pipelines close to a plane seabed were conducted with a hydro-elastic facility in a conventional water flume. The effects of the mass-damping parameter, the diameter ratio, the gap-to-diameter ratio, the spacing-to-diameter ratio and the position angle on the VIV response were studied. The VIV suppression for the piggyback pipeline system by the small pipe was investigated based on the analysis of the vibration amplitude and the critical reduced velocity for the onset of VIV. Comparison with the prediction with the modified Griffin plot by Govardhan and Williamson (2006) [10] shows that the peak vibration amplitude of near-wall piggyback pipelines is smaller than that for a wall-free single pipe. The configuration parameters of piggyback pipelines have significant effects on the VIV suppression. For the configuration of the small pipe above the main pipe ($\theta$= 90°), the minimum peak amplitude and the maximum critical reduced velocity occur at the spacing-to-diameter ratio of G/. D≈. 0.25, indicating that VIV is suppressed most effectively by the small pipe at this value of G/. D. For a constant value of G/. D= 0.25, both the minimum peak amplitude and the maximum critical reduced velocity occur at the position angle of $\theta$≈. 120°. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the present investigation, we study the dynamics of a cylinder which is allowed to rise or fall freely through a fluid. We find that falling cylinders, oriented horizontally, all descend in a rectilinear path. As one reduces the relative density (or mass ratio, m
                        *), such that m
                        * < 1 and the cylinders begin to rise, rectilinear trajectories are found to persist. However, when one falls below a special value of the relative density, the body suddenly commences large-amplitude transverse vibration, with horizontal fluctuations of nearly 2 diameters peak-to-peak. It turns out that the critical mass ratio for this phenomenon to appear, m

                        * = 0.54, agrees remarkably well with the critical value for elastically mounted cylinders, defining a similar sudden transition between states. The vigorously vibrating cylinder exhibits a 2P mode of vortex formation, as found previously for elastically mounted bodies in purely transverse motion. This is consistent with the fact that the critical values of relative densities are similar, although the closeness of the values is unexpected when one considers that the freely rising body exhibits streamwise motions. It appears that the existence of a critical relative density for the rising cylinder is a new phenomenon. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of three-dimensional (3D) vortex shedding flow in the wake of four circular cylinders in a square configuration with a constant space-to-diameter ratio of 2. Numerical tests are carried out for Reynolds number (Re) in the range from 100 to 500. Four wake flow regimes are identified at this spacing ratio. Regime 1 ( 100 ≤ Re ≤ 220 ) is characterized by the inclination of weak spanwise vortices and weak streamwise vortices, where the wake behind four cylinder array shares similar features to that behind a single cylinder with a large equivalent diameter. It is observed that the onset of three-dimensionality in the wake behind four cylinder array occurs at lower Re than that behind a single cylinder. Regime 2 ( 240 ≤ Re ≤ 300 ) is characterized by the appearance of the regular wavy spanwise vortices and rib-shaped streamwise vortices. The wavelength of the spanwise vortices is about 1.2 and the wake flow is similar to the transition mode B of a single cylinder. Regime 3 ( 320 ≤ Re ≤ 380 ) is characterized by severe vortex dislocations in the wake of the cylinders and regime 4 ( 400 ≤ Re ≤ 500 ) is characterized by the absence of vortex dislocations and the strong streamwise vortices. The flow between the upstream and the downstream cylinders is predominantly two-dimensional in regimes 1, 2, and 3 and becomes 3D in regime 4. Physical mechanisms responsible for different flow regimes are proposed and discussed in details. Significant changes in the root-mean-square force coefficients, wake formation length, and phase angle of the lift coefficients on the downstream cylinders are observed when the flow transits from one regime to another.},

An attempt is first made to categorize various cluster arrangements in terms of the number of pipes (cylinders), their mutual spacing and orientation to the oncoming current. The second step classifies the basic interference flow regimes in the subcritical, critical and postcritical states, for two pipes only, in all possible arrangements. The third step goes further and considers various clusters and distinguishes between the basic interference flow regimes, however modified they may be, and the additional ones for particular orientations. This approach allows some qualitative interpretation and even the prediction of the forces exerted on any of the pipes in the cluster, for various orientations.

abstract = {A wide variety of interference-induced oscillations of two parallel circular cylinders have occurred in engineering applications. The flow interference depends on spacing between the two cylinders and orientation relative to the free stream. Three categories of flow interference are proposed: proximity, wake and the combination of both. The oscillations caused by jet-switch, gap-flow-switch, wake-displacement and wake-galloping are discussed. These interference-induced oscillations are related to the reduced velocity, mass and structural damping (combined in a Scruton number) and to the number of degrees of freedom of the two cylinders. The reliable mathematical modelling is developed only for the wake galloping. Most means for suppressing vortex shedding are ineffective for the flow interference excitations.},

abstract = {Forces are measured at both ends of rigid cylinders with span 60 cm, performing transverse oscillations within an oncoming stream of water, at Reynolds number Re approximate to 3800. Forced harmonic motions and free vibrations of uniform and tapered cylinders are studied. To study free motions, a novel force-feedback control system has been developed, consisting of: (a) a force transducer, which measures forces on a section of a cylinder moving forward at constant speed; (b) a computer using the measured force signal to drive in real time a numerical simulation of an equivalent mass-dashpot-spring system; (c) a servomotor and linear table which impose, also in real time, the numerically calculated motion on the cylinder section. The apparatus allows very low equivalent system damping and strict control of the parametric values and structure of the equivalent system.Calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient between forces at the two ends of the uniform cylinder reveals five distinct regimes as a function of the nominal reduced velocity V-rn: two regimes, for low and high values of V-rn, and far away from the value of V-rs corresponding to the Strouhal frequency, show small correlation; two regimes immediately adjacent to, but excluding, V-rs show strong correlation, close to 1; surprisingly, there is a regime containing the Strouhal frequency, within which correlation is low. Free vibrations with a 40:1 tapered cylinder show that the regime of low correlation, containing the Strouhal frequency, stretches to higher reduced velocities, while lock-in starts at lower reduced velocities.When comparing the amplitude and phase of the lift coefficient measured for free and then for forced vibrations, we obtain close agreement, both for tapered and uniform cylinders. When comparing the cross-correlation coefficient, however, we find that it is much higher in the forced oscillations, especially for the uniform cylinder. Hence, although the force magnitude and phase may be replicated well in forced vibrations, the correlation data suggest that differences exist between free and forced vibration cases.},

abstract = {An experimental facility , the parallel case had five times the r.m.s. lift of the oblique case, a ratio which would become larger as the aspect ratio of the cylinder increases. However, despite this dependence upon Reynolds number in the magnitude of the lift force, the dominant nondimensional frequencies of the lift force were independent of Reynolds number, even in the present case offor the study of the forces and response associated with vortex-induced vibration of a rigid cylinder has been constructed with extraordinarily low normalized mass and normalized damping. This facility achieves a level of combined mass and damping which is an order of magnitude less than previous studies of this type. Measurements of the total integrated forces on a static cylinder demonstrate the importance of the end conditions. By varying the end conditions, the case of vortices shed parallel to the cylinder was compared to the oblique shedding case. The results show that the mean drag is consistently higher in the parallel shedding case, throughout our range of Reynolds number, whereas the variation in r.m.s. lift is highly dependent on Reynolds number. At Re = 12 000 cellular shedding. Our study of the response in the hydroelastic case has brought two previously neglected points to the fore. Our data at very low mass-damping ratio shows that the response has two branches of resonance. The implication at low mass-damping ratios is that there are actually two distinct levels of resonance, rather than a single one as previously assumed. The second observation is that the adjustment of the mass ratio affects the response, even when the combined mass-damping ratio is kept constant. An equation of motion is developed here, with inclusion of the inviscid "added-mass" force which will necessarily become important at low mass ratios.},

abstract = {We develop an ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) moving mesh method suitable for solving two-dimensional and axisymmetric moving-boundary problems, including the interaction between a free-surface and a solid structure. This method employs a body-fitted grid system where the gas-liquid interface and solid-liquid interface are lines of the grid system, and complicated dynamic boundary conditions are incorporated naturally and accurately in a Finite-Volume formulation. The resulting nonlinear system of mass and momentum conservation is then solved by a fractional step (projection) method. The method is validated on the uniform flow passing a cylinder (a two-dimensional flow with a solid structure) and several problems of bubble dynamics (axi-symmetrical flows with a free surface) for both steady and unsteady flows. Good agreement with other theoretical, numerical and experimental results is obtained. A further application is the investigation of a two-dimensional mechanical strider (a mass-spring system) interacting with a water surface, demonstrating the ability of the method in handling the interaction between a solid structure and a free surface. We find that the critical compression required to jump off the water surface varies linearly with spring constant for stiff springs and algebraically with exponent 0.7 for weak springs. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The mean and fluctuating velocity distributions were obtained using the laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurement. The digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was employed to characterize the full field vorticity and velocity distributions as well as other turbulent quantities. The experimental study indicated that several distinct flow patterns exist depending on the spacing ratio and subcritical Reynolds number for turbulent flow. The three-dimensional numerical simulations were also carried out using the large eddy simulation (LES) at Reynolds number of 15,000 with the spacing ratio of 1.5 and 3.5. The results show that the LES numerical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Therefore, the three-dimensional vortex structures and the full field instantaneous and mean quantities of the flow field such as velocity field, vorticity field, etc., which are very difficult to obtain experimentally, can be extracted from the simulation results for the deepening of our understanding on the complex flow phenomena around four cylinders in in-line configuration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@book{Tennekes1972,
abstract = {The subject of turbulence, the most forbidding in fluid dynamics, has usually proved treacherous to the beginner, caught in the whirls and eddies of its nonlinearities and statistical imponderables. This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. Moreover, the text has been developed for students, engineers, and scientists with different technical backgrounds and interests. Almost all flows, natural and man-made, are turbulent. Thus the subject is the concern of geophysical and environmental scientists (in dealing with atmospheric jet streams, ocean currents, and the flow of rivers, for example), of astrophysicists (in studying the photospheres of the sun and stars or mapping gaseous nebulae), and of engineers (in calculating pipe flows, jets, or wakes). Many such examples are discussed in the book. The approach taken avoids the difficulties of advanced mathematical development on the one side and the morass of experimental detail and empirical data on the other. As a result of following its midstream course, the text gives the student a physical understanding of the subject and deepens his intuitive insight into those problems that cannot now be rigorously solved. In particular, dimensional analysis is used extensively in dealing with those problems whose exact solution is mathematically elusive. Dimensional reasoning, scale arguments, and similarity rules are introduced at the beginning and are applied throughout. A discussion of Reynolds stress and the kinetic theory of gases provides the contrast needed to put mixing-length theory into proper perspective: the authors present a thorough comparison between the mixing-length models and dimensional analysis of shear flows. This is followed by an extensive treatment of vorticity dynamics, including vortex stretching and vorticity budgets. Two chapters are devoted to boundary-free shear flows and well-bounded turbulent shear flows. The examples presented include wakes, jets, shear layers, thermal plumes, atmospheric boundary layers, pipe and channel flow, and boundary layers in pressure gradients. The spatial structure of turbulent flow has been the subject of analysis in the book up to this point, at which a compact but thorough introduction to statistical methods is given. This prepares the reader to understand the stochastic and spectral structure of turbulence. The remainder of the book consists of applications of the statistical approach to the study of turbulent transport (including diffusion and mixing) and turbulent spectra.},

Computations, restricted to 2-D, are carried out for Reynolds numbers 100 for various values of the structural frequency of the oscillator. The cylinders are separated by 5,5 times the cylinder diameter in the streamwise direction. For the staggered arrangement, the cross-flow spacing between the two cylinders is 0.7 times the cylinder diameter. In this arrangement, the downstream cylinder lies in the wake of the upstream one and therefore experiences an unsteady in-flow. Since the spacing between the two cylinders is beyond the critical value for proximity interference, it is expected that the upstream cylinder behaves like an isolated single cylinder, while the dQwnstream one experiences wake-induced flutter. The Re = 100 flow leads to a very organized wake and large amplitude motion is observed for the downstream cylinder. The trajectory of the upstream cylinder resembles a figure-of-eight. The downstream cylinder shows a similar behaviour for the tandem arrangement. However, for the staggered arrange- ment, the trajectory of the rear cylinder resembles a tilted oval. Soft lock-in is observed in almost all the cases.},

abstract = {This paper deals with an experimental investigation of the dynamic response of a long flexible circular cylinder in the wake of a stationary geometrically similar cylinder. The system has a low damping ratio. The tandem and staggered arrangements have been considered. The separations investigated are typical of transmission line bundles and range from 7 to 25 diameters and Reynolds number ranges from 5 000 to 27 000. For the tandem cylinders, the results indicate that (a) the dynamic response of the downstream cylinder is no longer hysteretic, (b) the synchronization onset is at higher reduced velocities and (c) the synchronization region is wider than that of an isolated cylinder; this region is twice as large for a separation of 10 diameters and decreases with increasing spacing. Despite the absence of the hysteresis loop and its associated discontinuities, two vortex patterns are present around the resonance velocity. A small decrease of the maximum amplitude of oscillation with increasing spacing has also been observed, as well as a reduction of the velocity for which this maximum occurs. For separations of 7 and 85 diameters, the leeward cylinder exhibits a combination of vortex-induced and wake-galloping oscillations. For the staggered arrangement, the increase of the stagger angle beta reduces the synchronization onset velocity and the synchronization region and beyond beta = 20 degrees the downstream cylinder behaves as an isolated one.

At a critical Re, the dividing line between these symmetric vortices becomes unstable and folds up on itself, resulting in alternate vortex shedding. On the other hand, for the parallel triangular array no vortex shedding was observed behind cylinders in any row of the rigid array, although attached eddies of recirculating flow did form behind the cylinders; when one of the third or fifth row rigid cylinders was replaced by a flexible cylinder, it exhibited large amplitude vibrations which caused the bound vortices to be shed and swept downstream in an antisymmetric manner.},

Based upon these experiments, a mathematical model with which to describe the flow-induced excitation and reaction (damping) forces on a vibrating tube has been developed and is presented here. These results are applicable in general not only to the resonant, vortex-excited vibrations of flexibly mounted rigid tubes, but also to a flexible tube in air, water and other similar fluids.},

abstract = {Oscillatory flow past two circular cylinders in side-by-side and tandem arrangements at low Reynolds numbers is simulated numerically by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a finite-element method (FEM). The aim of this study is to identify the flow regimes of the two-cylinder system at different gap arrangements and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers (KC). Simulations are conducted at seven gap ratios G (G = L/D where L is the cylinder-to-cylinder gap and D the diameter of a cylinder) of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and KC ranging from 1 to 12 with an interval of 0.25. The flow regimes that have been identified for oscillatory flow around a single cylinder are also observed in the two-cylinder system but with different flow patterns due to the interactions between the two cylinders. In the side-by-side arrangement, the vortex shedding from the gap between the two cylinders dominates when the gap ratio is small, resulting in the gap vortex shedding (GVS) regime, which is different from any of the flow regimes identified for a single cylinder. For intermediate gap ratios of 1.5 and 2 in the side-by-side arrangement, the vortex shedding mode from one side of each cylinder is not necessarily the same as that from the other side, forming a so-called combined flow regime. When the gap ratio between the two cylinders is sufficiently large, the vortex shedding from each cylinder is similar to that of a single cylinder. In the tandem arrangement, when the gap between the two cylinders is very small, the flow regimes are similar to that of a single cylinder. For large gap ratios in the tandem arrangement, the vortex shedding flows from the gap side of the two cylinders interact and those from the outer sides of the cylinders are less affected by the existence of the other cylinder and similar to that of a single cylinder. Strong interaction between the vortex shedding flows from the two cylinders makes the flow very irregular at large KC values for both side-by-side and tandem arrangements.},

abstract = {This paper describes a study of the local and global effect of an isolated group of cylinders on an incident uniform flow. Using high resolution two-dimensional computations, we analysed the flow through and around a localised circular array of cylinders, where the ratio of array diameter (D(G)) to cylinder diameter (D) is 21. The number of cylinders varied from N(C) = 7 to 133, and they were arranged in a series of concentric rings to allow even distribution within the array with an average void fraction phi = N(C)(D/DG)(2), which varied from 0.016 to 0.30. The characteristic Reynolds number of the array was Re(G) = 2100. A range of diagnostic tools were applied, including the lift/drag forces on each cylinder (and the whole array), Eulerian and Lagrangian average velocity within the array, and the decay of maximum vorticity with distance downstream. To interpret the flow field, we used vorticity and the dimensionless form of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor. A mathematical model, based on representing the bodies as point forces, sources and dipoles, was applied to interpret the results. Three distinct flow regimes were identified. For low void fractions (phi < 0.05), the cylinders have uncoupled individual wake patterns, where the vorticity is rapidly annihilated by wake intermingling downstream and the forces are similar to that of an isolated cylinder. At intermediate void fractions (0.05< phi < 0.15), a shear layer is generated at the shoulders of the array and the force acting on the cylinders is steady. For high void fractions (phi > 0.15), the array generates a wake in a similar way to a solid body of the same scale. For low void fraction arrays, the mathematical model provides a reasonable assessment of the forces on individual bodies within the array, the Eulerian mean velocity and the upstream velocity field. While it broadly captures the change in the rate of decay of the maximum vorticity magnitude Omega(max) downstream, the magnitude is underpredicted.},

abstract = {In fluid-structure interaction studies, such as vortex-induced vibration, one needs to select essential parameters for the system, such as mass, spring stiffness, and damping. Normally, these parameters are set physically by the mechanical arrangement. However, our approach utilizes a combination of a physical system, comprises a fluid and a mechanical actuator, and a cyber system, taking the form of a computer-based force-feedback controller. This arrangement allows us to impose mass-spring-damping parameters in virtual space and in up to six degrees of freedom. [A similar concept, in one degree of freedom, was pioneered by a group at MIT (see Hover et al., 1998), in studies of vortex-induced vibration of cables.] Although the use of a cyber-physical system has clear advantages over using a purely physical experiment, there are serious challenges to overcome in the design of the governing control system. Our controller, based on a discretization of Newton's laws, makes it straightforward to add and modify any kind of nonlinear, time-varying, or directional force: it is virtually specified but imposed on a physical object. We implement this idea in both a first-generation and a second-generation facility. In this paper, we present preliminary applications of this approach in flow-structure interactions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the present paper the author finds that two antiphase streets are indeed formed, although in-phase shedding leads to the development of a single large-scale wake. The vortices which are formed simultaneously at the cylinders rotate around one another downstream, each pair forming a 'binary vortex'. The combined wake comprises a street of such vortices, which we term a binary vortex street. Below a critical gap size between the bluff bodies the flow becomes asymmetric. In this regime certain harmonic modes of vortex shedding are observed whereby the shedding frequency on one side of the wake is a multiple of that on the other. Again, a large-scale wake is formed downstream.},

As ∣ $\alpha$ ∣ increases, flow becomes stabilized and finally a steady state beyond the critical rotational speed depending on the gap spacing. In the cases of gap spacings of 3 and 0.2, the wake patterns keep the antiphase-synchronized pattern and the single bluff body pattern, respectively, until flow reaches the steady state. However, for the gap spacings of 1.5 and 0.7, the wake patterns change in the unsteady regime. For the gap spacing of 1.5, the wake pattern shows in-phase-synchronized, flip-flop and antiphase-synchronized patterns in turn according to ∣ $\alpha$ ∣ . For the gap spacing of 0.7, the flip-flopping wake pattern is changed as the in-phase-synchronized pattern behind the cylinder with the one-row vortex street in downstream with increasing ∣ $\alpha$ ∣ .},

abstract = {The motions of vortices around single cylinders and around pairs of cylinders in relative sinusoidal flow are investigated in this paper. Using simultaneous flow visualization and force measurements, the vortex motions are related to the fluid-induced lift and in-line forces. For the single cylinder, several repeatable patterns of vortex shedding are identified within particular ranges of flow amplitude. The process of pairing of vortices from a previous half cycle with those in a present half cycle is fundamental to all the patterns. Visualization is shown to be more effective in a reference frame which is fixed with respect to the undisturbed fluid rather than with respect to the cylinders. For this reason, the examples of vortex motions are taken from a rig in which vertical cylinders are oscillated in a tank of fluid. By oscillating a pair of cylinders over a range of gaps, orientations and amplitudes, it is found that the vortex-shedding patterns identified for a single cylinder can synchronize either in phase or in antiphase between the two cylinders. Such observations help to explain how lift and in-line forces are influenced by cylinder proximity and in some cases these forces are significantly magnified. Force coefficients are evaluated for both the single cylinder and the pair of cylinders.},

The maximum oscillation amplitude occurs near the lower limit of the lock-in region, while no substantial differences in final response are detectable between the cylinder amplitude developing from rest and the free stream velocity being varied with the cylinder already oscillating.

abstract = {In many industrial applications, mechanical structures like heat exchanger tube bundles are subjected to complex flows causing possible vibrations and damage. Part of fluid forces are coupled with tube motion and the so-called fluid-elastic forces can affect the structure dynamic behaviour generating possible instabilities and leading to possible short term failures through high amplitude vibrations. Most classical fluid force identification methods rely on structure response experimental measurements associated with conveneint data processes. Owing to recent improvements in Computational Fluid Dynamics, numerical simulation of flow-induced vibrations is now practicable for industrial purposes. The present paper is devoted to the numerical identification of fluid-elastic effects affecting tube bundle motion in presence of fluid at rest and one-phase cross-flows. What is the numerical process? When fluid-elastic effects are not significant and are restricted to added mass effects, there is no strong coupling between structure and fluid motions. The structure displacement is not supposed to affect flow patterns. Thus it is possible to solve flow and structure problems separately by using a fixed nonmoving mesh for the fluid dynamic computation. Power spectral density and time record of lift and drag forces acting on tube bundles can be computed numerically by using an unsteady fluid computation involving for example a large Eddy simulation. Fluid force spectra or time record can then be introduced as inlet conditions into the structure code providing the tube dynamic response generated by flow. Such a computation is not possible in presence of strong flow structure coupling. When fluid-elastic effects cannot be neglected, in presence of tube bundles subjected to cross-flows for example, a coupling between flow and structure computations is required. Appropriate numerical methods are investigated in the present work. The purpose is to be able to provide a numerical estimate of the critical flow velocity for the threshold of fluid-elastic instability of tube bundle without experimental investigation. The methodology consists in simulating in the same time thermohydraulics and mechanics problems by using an arbitrary Lagrange Euler (ALE) formulation for the fluid computation. A fully coupled numerical approach is suggested and applied to the numerical prediction of the vibration frequency of a flexible tube belonging to a fixed tube bundle in fluid at rest or in flow. Numerical results turn out to be consistent with available experimental data obtained in the same configuration. This work is a first step in the definition of a computational process for the full numerical prediction of tube bundle vibrations induced by flows. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Vortex induced vibrations of two equal-sized cylinders in tandem and staggered arrangement placed in uniform incompressible flow is studied. A stabilized finite element formulation is utilized to solve the governing equations. The Reynolds number for these 2D simulations is 1000. The cylinders are separated by 5.5 times the cylinder diameter in the streamwise direction. For the staggered arrangement, the cross-flow spacing between the two cylinders is 0.7 times the cylinder diameter. In this arrangement, the downstream cylinder lies in the wake of the upstream one and therefore experiences an unsteady inflow. The wake looses its temporal periodicity, beyond a few diameters downstream of the front cylinder. The upstream cylinder responds as an isolated single cylinder while the downstream one undergoes disorganized motion. Soft-lock-in is observed in almost all the cases.},

Further, we illustrate the complementary nature of experiments and computations in turbulence research. Examples are provided where DNS data has been used to evaluate measurement accuracy.

abstract = {Vortex shedding may occur in tube arrays, resulting in strong excitation forces at discrete frequencies. In the past, the Strouhal numbers governing vortex shedding in these systems were determined primarily by experiment. This paper presents a computationally inexpensive method of numerical simulation for the unsteady flow through a rigid normal triangular tube array which determines both the frequency of vortex shedding and the instaneous flow structure. The technique used is based on a discrete vortex method similar to the cloud-in-cell approach which has been applied to flow problems for small numbers of cylinders. However, in the current implementation, the flow velocity calculation is carried out on an unstructured grid using a finite element discretization. Thus, the complex geometry associated with a tube array can be easily accommodated. The method, referred to as the "Cloud-in-element" method, is validated for the standard case of flow over a single cylinder and then applied to flow through a normal triangular array with a pitch-to-diameter of 1.6. The Reynolds number is 2200. The Strouhal number obtained from the numerical simulation is 1.27, which is within 6% of the value available in the literature. Qualitatively, the vortex shedding pattern obtained is in agreement with published flow visualization. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Two-degree-of-freedom Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of two rigidly coupled circular cylinders of different diameters at a low Reynolds number of 250 is investigated numerically. While the diameter ratio and the mass ratio are kept constant, the study is focused on the effect of the position angle of the small cylinder on the lock-in regime of the VIV. Simulations are carried out for position angles $\alpha$ of the small cylinder ranging from 0° to 180° with an interval of 22.5° and the reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 with an increment of 1. In order to find the effect of the gap between the two cylinders on the vibration, two gap-to-diameter ratios (0 and 0.2) are considered. It is found that compared with a single cylinder case, the lock-in regime of the reduced velocity is widened significantly when the position angle of the small cylinder is $\alpha$ = 0°, 22.5°, 90°, or 112.5°. Pulsed beating phenomenon characterized by regular vibration with occasional high-amplitude disturbances at regular or irregular intervals is observed at G = 0 and $\alpha$ = 90°. At $\alpha$ = 135°, more than one lock-in regimes are observed in the computed range of reduced velocity for both gaps (G = 0 and 0.2). Setting a small gap (gap-to-diameter ratio of 0.2) between the two cylinders mitigates the vibration by narrowing the lock-in regime and reducing the vibration amplitude.},

abstract = {Any device aiming to harness the abundant clean and renewable energy from ocean and other water resources must have high energy density, be unobtrusive, have low maintenance, be robust, meet life cycle cost targets, and have a 10-20 year life. The vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy (VIVACE) converter - invented by Bernitsas and Raghavan, patent pending through the University of Michigan - satisfies those criteria. It converts ocean/river current hydrokinetic energy to a usable form of energy such as electricity using VIV successfully and efficiently for the first time. VIVACE is based on the idea of maximizing rather than spoiling vortex shedding and exploiting rather than suppressing VIV. It introduces optimal damping for energy conversion while maintaining VIV over a broad range of vortex shedding synchronization. VIV occurs over very broad ranges of Reynolds (Re) number. Only three transition regions suppress VIV. Thus, even from currents as slow as 0.25 m/s, VIVACE can extract energy with high power conversion ratio making ocean/river current energy a more accessible and economically viable resource. In this paper the underlying concepts of the VIVACE converter are discussed. The designs of the physical model and laboratory prototype are presented. A mathematical model is developed, and design particulars for a wide range of application scales are calculated. Experimental measurements on the laboratory prototype are reported in the sequel paper and used here for preliminary benchmarking. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by ASME.},

abstract = {Oscillatory flow past two circular cylinders in side-by-side and tandem arrangements at low Reynolds numbers is simulated numerically by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a finite-element method (FEM). The aim of this study is to identify the flow regimes of the two-cylinder system at different gap arrangements and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers (KC). Simulations are conducted at seven gap ratios G (G = L/D where L is the cylinder-to-cylinder gap and D the diameter of a cylinder) of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and KC ranging from 1 to 12 with an interval of 0.25. The flow regimes that have been identified for oscillatory flow around a single cylinder are also observed in the two-cylinder system but with different flow patterns due to the interactions between the two cylinders. In the side-by-side arrangement, the vortex shedding from the gap between the two cylinders dominates when the gap ratio is small, resulting in the gap vortex shedding (GVS) regime, which is different from any of the flow regimes identified for a single cylinder. For intermediate gap ratios of 1.5 and 2 in the side-by-side arrangement, the vortex shedding mode from one side of each cylinder is not necessarily the same as that from the other side, forming a so-called combined flow regime. When the gap ratio between the two cylinders is sufficiently large, the vortex shedding from each cylinder is similar to that of a single cylinder. In the tandem arrangement, when the gap between the two cylinders is very small, the flow regimes are similar to that of a single cylinder. For large gap ratios in the tandem arrangement, the vortex shedding flows from the gap side of the two cylinders interact and those from the outer sides of the cylinders are less affected by the existence of the other cylinder and similar to that of a single cylinder. Strong interaction between the vortex shedding flows from the two cylinders makes the flow very irregular at large KC values for both side-by-side and tandem arrangements.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of three-dimensional (3-D) laminar flow around four circular cylinders in an in-line square configuration. The investigation focuses on effects of spacing ratio (L/D) and aspect ratio (H/D) on 3-D flow characteristics, and the force and pressure coefficients of the cylinders. Extensive 3-D numerical simulations were performed at Reynolds number of 200 for L/D from 1.6 to 5.0 at H/D=16 and H/D from 6 to 20 at L/D=3.5. The results show that the 3-D numerical simulations have remedied the inadequacy of 2-D simulations and the results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The relation between 3-D flow patterns and pressure characteristics around the four cylinders is examined and discussed. The critical spacing ratio for flow pattern transformation was found to be L/D=3.5 for H/D=16, while a bistable wake pattern was observed at L/D=1.6 for the same aspect ratio. Moreover, a transformation of flow pattern from a stable shielding flow pattern to a vortex shedding flow pattern near the middle spanwise positions of the cylinders was observed and was found to be dependent on the aspect ratio, spacing ratio, and end wall conditions. Due to the highly 3-D nature of the flows, different flow patterns coexist over different spanwise positions of the cylinders even for the same aspect ratio. It is concluded that spacing ratio, aspect ratio, and the no-slip end wall condition have important combined effects on free shear layer development of the cylinders and hence have significant effects on the pressure field and force characteristics of the four cylinders with different spacing ratios and aspect ratios. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {General estimates are derived for mean velocities through and around groups or arrays of fixed and moving bodies, in unbounded and bounded domains, which lie within a defined perimeter. Robust kinematic flow concepts are introduced, namely the Eulerian spatial mean Velocity (u) over bar (E) in the fluid volume between the bodies, the Eulerian flow outside the group, u(E)((0)), E and the Lagrangian mean velocity of material surfaces or fluid particles as they pass through the group of bodies ((u) over bar ((S))(L), (u) over barL((P))). The Eulerian mean velocity is related to the momentum in the fluid d 0 main, and is mainly influenced by fast moving regions of the flow. The Lagrangian mean velocity weights slowly moving regions of flow and is related to how material sheets deform as they are advected through groups of bodies. When the bodies are well-separated, the interstitial Eulerian and Lagrangian mean velocities ((u) over bar ((1))(E), (u) over bar ((1))(L)), are defined and calculated in terms of the far-field contributions from the velocity or displacement field within the group of bodies.In unbounded flow past well-separated bodies situated within a rectangular perimeter, the difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian mean velocity is negligible (as the void fraction of the bodies, alpha --> 0). Within wide and short rectangular arrays, the Eulerian mean velocity is faster than the free-stream velocity U because most of the incident flow passes through the array and (u) over bar (E) = U(1 - alpha)(-1). Within long and thin rectangular arrays (and other cases where the reflux velocity is negligible), the Eulerian mean velocity, (u) over bar (E) = U(1 - (1 + C-m)alpha)/(1 - alpha), is slower than the free-stream velocity, because most of the incident flow passes around the array. For a spherical or circular arrays of bodies, the particle Lagrangian mean velocity is (u) over bar ((P))(L) = U(1 + C(m)alpha)(-1) and differs from (u) over bar (E). These calculations are extended to examine the mean and interstitial flow through clouds of bodies in bounded channel flows.The new concepts are applied to calculate the mean flow and pressure between and outside clouds of bodies, the average velocity of bubbly flows as a function of void fraction, and the tendency of clouds of bubbles to be distorted depending on their shape.},

abstract = {Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a square cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100 and a low mass ratio of 3 are studied numerically by solving the Navier-Stokes equations using the finite element method. The equation of motion of the square cylinder is solved to simulate the vibration and the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian scheme is employed to model the interaction between the vibrating cylinder and the fluid flow. The numerical model is validated against the published results of flow past a stationary square cylinder and the results of VIV of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds numbers. The effect of flow approaching angle ($\alpha$) on the response of the square cylinder is investigated. It is found that $\alpha$ affects not only the vibration amplitude but also the lock-in regime. Among the three values of $\alpha$ ($\alpha$ = 0°, 45°, and 22.5°) that are studied, the smallest vibration amplitude and the narrowest lock-in regime occur at $\alpha$ = 0°. It is discovered that the vibration locks in with the natural frequency in two regimes of reduced velocity for $\alpha$ = 22.5°. Single loop vibration trajectories are observed in the lock-in regime at $\alpha$ = 22.5° and 45°, which is distinctively different from VIV of a circular cylinder. As a result, the vibration frequency in the in-line direction is the same as that in the cross-flow direction.},

abstract = {Fundamental research on vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a circular cylinder is still needed to build more rational VIV analysis tools for slender marine structures. Numerical results are presented for the response of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder at low mass damping constrained to oscillate transversely to a free stream. A two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) code equipped with the SST k−$\omega$ turbulence model is applied for the numerical calculations. The numerical results are compared in detail with recent experimental and computational work. The Reynolds-averaging procedure erases the random disturbances in the vortex shedding process, so that the comparison between experimental data and the numerical results obtained by RANS codes may reveal some random characteristics of the VIV response. How random disturbance affects the observation in the experiments is discussed in this paper and the issues influencing the appearance of the upper branch in experiments are especially investigated. The absence of the upper branch in RANS simulations is explained in depth on account of discrepancies, which exist between experiments and RANS simulations. In addition, the formation of the 2P vortex shedding mode and its transition through the lock-in region are well reproduced in this investigation.},

The experiments were carried out at a subcritical Reynolds number of 2100. Square array arrangements of the cylinders with varying spacing ratios and angles of incidence were examined. A bistable state of a wide and a narrow wake is seen behind the downstream cylinders at zero angle of incidence, while in the staggered positions the Strouhal frequency shows a unique trend for the four cylinders. At a rotated square position, the wake of the front-most cylinder shrinks significantly, yet maintains vortex shedding at a very small spacing ratio. A far downstream wake oscillation is observed behind the cylinders when they are close to each other; the Strouhal number of the cluster is around 0{\textperiodcentered}22-0{\textperiodcentered}24. A dimensionless relationship between the vortex-shedding frequency and the wake width is proposed according to the experimental data in this experiment. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Computations are presented of two-dimensional flow characteristics and interactive forces associated with flows around four equispaced cylinders of equal diameter, and two cylinders, one with circular cross-section and the other elliptical. It was found that behaviour such as in-phase vortex-shedding, anti-phase vortex shedding and synchronized vortex shedding, which are well-known characteristics for flows past arrangements of two circular cylinders, were also present in these more complicated flows. The application of the cell boundary element method to these flow problems, using an unstructured fluid domain mesh idealization, proved straightforward and required no modification for variation of the number of bodies or their shape.},

abstract = {The instability and transition of flow past two circular cylinders arranged in tandem are investigated numerically. A steady symmetric flow is realized at small Reynolds numbers, but the flow becomes unstable above a critical Reynolds number and makes a transition to an oscillatory flow. We obtained the symmetric flow numerically and analyze its stability by applying linear stability theory. The nonlinear oscillatory flow arising from the instability is obtained not only by numerical simulation but also by direct numerical calculation of the equilibrium solution, and the bifurcation diagram for the nonlinear equilibrium solution is depicted. We focused our attention on the effect of the gap spacing between the two cylinders on the stability and transition of the flow. The transition of the flow from a steady state to an oscillatory state is clarified to occur due to a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation depending upon the gap spacing. We found that there is a certain range of the gap spacing where physical quantities such as the drag and lift coefficients and the Strouhal number show an abrupt change when the gap spacing is continuously changed. We identified the origin of the abrupt change as the existence of multiple stable solutions for the flow.},

Similarly, a??cylinder undergoing forced transverse oscillations in a free stream flow exhibits two different wake states, with an additional third state at high oscillation amplitudes. In this paper the characteristic lift properties and patterns of near wake vorticity for the forced wake states are compared with those of the free response branches. The forced oscillations are shown to replicate many features of the freely oscillating case. However, these results also show that there are some important aspects to be resolved before forced oscillations can be used to predict flow-induced motion. ?? 2003 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {In this paper, we present some numerical results from a study of the dynamics and fluid forcing on an elastically mounted rigid cylinder with low mass-damping, constrained to oscillate transversely to a free stream. The vortex shedding around the cylinder is investigated numerically by the incompressible two-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. These equations are written in a primitive formulation in which the Cartesian velocity components and pressure share the same location at the center of the control volume. The numerical method uses a consistent physical reconstruction for the mass and momentum fluxes: the so-called consistent physical interpolation (CPI) approach in a conservative discretization using finite volumes on structured grids. The turbulence modeling is carried out by the SST K–$\omega$ model of Menter (AIAA 24th Fluid Dynamics Conference, Orlando, FL, USA). The numerical results are compared with the 1996 experimental results of Khalak and Williamson (J. Fluids Struct. 10 (1996) 455). The Reynolds number is in the range 900–15 000, the reduced velocity is including between 1.0 and 17.0. The mass ratio is 2.4 and the mass-damping is 0.013. Several initial conditions are used. According the initial condition used, the simulations predict correctly the maximum amplitude. On the other hand, the numerical results do not match the upper branch found experimentally. However, these results are encouraging, because no simulations have yet predicted such a high amplitude of vibration.},
